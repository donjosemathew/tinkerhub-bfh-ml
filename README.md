# Chakka Manga Classifier
Chakka Manga Classifier is an üòéML Project for classifying images of üçêChakka(JackFruit) and ü•≠Manga(Mango) using TensorFlow.We are using Keras library to train model.And we got accuracy 65.It is our first ML Project and it is an awesome project. We spend almost 8 days completing our project.Our project aims to develop a web portal which uses an ML model based on Convelutional Neural Networks to differentiate between images of jackfruits and those of mangoes. We have made our model using tools provided by the tensor flow library and scikit learn library.
